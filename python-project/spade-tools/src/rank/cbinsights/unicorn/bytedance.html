WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     A growing number of lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to grant a reprieve to prevent TikTok from going dark in the United States as soon as Sunday, warning millions of creators and businesses could be hurt. &quot;We&#x27;re asking for the ability to be able to try rationally to resolve this issue so TikTok does not go dark,&quot; Democratic Senator Ed Markey said on Thursday. &quot;Let&#x27;s take a breath, try to step back, buy some time, try to figure this out.&quot; Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer spoke to Biden urging him to extend by 90 days a deadline for Chinese-owner ByteDance to sell TikTok U.S. assets and prevent a ban of the app used by 170 million Americans, an aide to Schumer said. &quot;It&#x27;s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans, of so many influencers who have built up a good network of followers,&quot; Schumer said. Congress in April ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok within 270 days, citing national security concerns. The Justice Department said this month &quot;TikTok&#x27;s collection of reams of sensitive data about 170 million Americans and their contacts makes it a powerful tool for espionage&quot; for China. A White House official said on Thursday that given that the Jan. 19 deadline date is &quot;over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement.&quot; The White House previously said Biden did not plan to issue an extension. On Wednesday, Reuters reported TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve. Markey and fellow Democratic senators Cory Booker and Chris Van Hollen wrote Biden asking him to grant an extension. &quot;Over the past few days, it has become clear that, without action from you, TikTok will likely go dark on Sunday, with serious consequences for the 170 million Americans and 7 million businesses that rely on TikTok,&quot; the senators wrote. &quot;Your administration represents the last chance to avoid a TikTok shutdown on Sunday,&quot; they wrote.

Congress in April ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok within 270 days, citing national security concerns. The Justice Department said this month \"TikTok's collection of reams of sensitive data about 170 million Americans and their contacts makes it a powerful tool for espionage\" for China. A White House official said on Thursday that given that the Jan. 19 deadline date is \"over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement.\" The White House previously said Biden did not plan to issue an extension. On Wednesday, Reuters reported TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve. Markey and fellow Democratic senators Cory Booker and Chris Van Hollen wrote Biden asking him to grant an extension. \"Over the past few days, it has become clear that, without action from you, TikTok will likely go dark on Sunday, with serious consequences for the 170 million Americans and 7 million businesses that rely on TikTok,\" the senators wrote. \"Your administration represents the last chance to avoid a TikTok shutdown on Sunday,\" they wrote.

Here's why this social app is rising in popularity again","content":"While a TikTok ban looms over the US, users are flocking to Lemon8 (again). Here's everything you need to know about it. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images\nA TikTok ban hangs over the US due to a bill signed into law in April 2024 that gives the federal government the authority to ban foreign apps it deems harmful to national security. TikTok is currently on the chopping block, awaiting a decision from the US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) on whether the law is constitutional. While US users wait for TikTok's fate, some are exploring an app called Lemon8 to see if it can be the \"next\" TikTok. Lemon8 is not a new app; it received millions of downloads after its US launch in 2023. The hype for it died shortly after, but it's rising in popularity again. Some users describe Lemon8 as if \"Instagram and Pinterest had a baby,\" comparing the app to Instagram's photo-first operability and Pinterest's \"inspo\" content and aesthetically pleasing themes. ByteDance, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, also owns Lemon8. Therefore, if SCOTUS rules that it's constitutional to ban TikTok, Lemon8's fate will be in the hands of the US government, too. Lemon8 is a video and photo-sharing social media app. It doesn't support vertical video scrolling like TikTok, and the content created on the app usually centers around a specific topic. The app's top trending topics are fashion, beauty, food, wellness, and travel. Under each topic are suggestions, recommendations, get-ready-with-me-style videos, and perfectly curated, aesthetically pleasing content. Fashion influencers on Lemon8 can \"tag\" where they bought their clothes and how much they cost. Lemon8 is most akin to Instagram in that the content created on the app aims to influence you to buy something that is more similar to your favorite influencer. Instagram is notorious for \"contrived spontaneity,\" or the idea that a perfect moment or photo occurred naturally. Spectators are now more aware that most content on Instagram is edited or staged in some way, which has recently driven some users away from the app. But those who enjoy aesthetically pleasing content can find it on Lemon8, free of the things they don't like about Instagram's interface. Who owns Lemon8? Lemon8 is owned by ByteDance, the same company that owns TikTok. It is ByteDance's attempt to compete with US-based Instagram, an app owned by Meta. Meta is slowly losing approval among American users , and users are searching for alternatives. But if Lemon8 soars in popularity, its fate will be at just as much risk in the US as its sister company TikTok. Still, US users are looking for an app to fall on if TikTok disappears, and Lemon8 is capitalizing on the frenzy. Can Lemon8 replace TikTok? Lemon8 and TikTok are two very different apps that serve different audiences. TikTok is a short-form video platform first, and its algorithm is great at showing users the content they want to see. Lemon8, on the other hand, is a photo-first platform. Additionally, the app heavily focuses on aesthetically pleasing lifestyle content, like fashion, makeup, skincare, and travel. In my experience using both apps, TikTok appeals to a more general audience -- anyone can go on TikTok and find creators and content they're interested in, even if it's a niche topic. Lemon8's user base consists mostly of young women who use the app as a visual blog. You won't find content about sports, history, current events, or anything else. I kept Lemon8 downloaded on my phone for about a week before I realized the app wasn't for me. Of course, every app has its pitfalls in the beginning. When it was first created, TikTok was an app for lip-syncing and dancing, but over the years, it's become a completely different platform. If TikTok goes under, a similar transformation could happen on Lemon8 -- if it doesn't get banned first. How many people are on Lemon8? According to the Associated Press, Lemon8 has around 1 million active users , far less than TikTok's 170 million active users. When Lemon8 first rose to popularity in 2023, it lacked big-name content creators, mainly because they found more success on TikTok and Instagram Reels.","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-lemon8-heres-why-this-social-app-is-rising-in-popularity-again/"},{"date":"2025-01-17","title":"What is Lemon8?

Lemon8 is most akin to Instagram in that the content created on the app aims to influence you to buy something that is more similar to your favorite influencer. Instagram is notorious for \"contrived spontaneity,\" or the idea that a perfect moment or photo occurred naturally. Spectators are now more aware that most content on Instagram is edited or staged in some way, which has recently driven some users away from the app. But those who enjoy aesthetically pleasing content can find it on Lemon8, free of the things they don't like about Instagram's interface. Who owns Lemon8? Lemon8 is owned by ByteDance, the same company that owns TikTok. It is ByteDance's attempt to compete with US-based Instagram, an app owned by Meta. Meta is slowly losing approval among American users , and users are searching for alternatives. But if Lemon8 soars in popularity, its fate will be at just as much risk in the US as its sister company TikTok. Still, US users are looking for an app to fall on if TikTok disappears, and Lemon8 is capitalizing on the frenzy. Can Lemon8 replace TikTok? Lemon8 and TikTok are two very different apps that serve different audiences. TikTok is a short-form video platform first, and its algorithm is great at showing users the content they want to see. Lemon8, on the other hand, is a photo-first platform. Additionally, the app heavily focuses on aesthetically pleasing lifestyle content, like fashion, makeup, skincare, and travel. In my experience using both apps, TikTok appeals to a more general audience -- anyone can go on TikTok and find creators and content they're interested in, even if it's a niche topic. Lemon8's user base consists mostly of young women who use the app as a visual blog. You won't find content about sports, history, current events, or anything else. I kept Lemon8 downloaded on my phone for about a week before I realized the app wasn't for me. Of course, every app has its pitfalls in the beginning. When it was first created, TikTok was an app for lip-syncing and dancing, but over the years, it's become a completely different platform. If TikTok goes under, a similar transformation could happen on Lemon8 -- if it doesn't get banned first. How many people are on Lemon8? According to the Associated Press, Lemon8 has around 1 million active users , far less than TikTok's 170 million active users. When Lemon8 first rose to popularity in 2023, it lacked big-name content creators, mainly because they found more success on TikTok and Instagram Reels.","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-lemon8-heres-why-this-social-app-is-rising-in-popularity-again/"},{"date":"2025-01-17","title":"Apple Intelligence Struggling To Gain Ground","content":"While Apple may have been the top smartphone vendor globally in 2024 with 232.1 million units shipped worldwide, it is slipping in one of its most important markets of China, with analysts attributing that to its inability to launch Apple Intelligence there. According to research firm IDC, Apple had an 18.7% global market share last year, down from 20.1% in the previous year. It released its AI platform, Apple Intelligence, last year and gradually rolled that out across various markets including Australia where it arrived in December. However, it has been unable to release its AI tools in China due to local regulatory requirements in that country. On the other hand, Chinese brands such as Huawei and Vivo, have released smartphones with AI features, and are quickly gaining market share in China. At the end of 2023 Apple held a 19% market share of mobile shipments according to research from Canalys, but at the end of 2024, Apple had fallen to third position with 15% market share. It was overtaken by Huawei with 16% market share, and Vivo with a 17% market share. “This past quarter was particularly remarkable for the largest Chinese smartphone vendors: Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Honor, Huawei, Lenovo, realme, Transsion, TCL, and ZTE. They achieved a historic milestone as they shipped the highest combined volume ever in a quarter, representing 56% of the global smartphone shipments in Q4,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for EMEA Client Devices, IDC. Apple’s main rival Samsung isn’t a top-five brand in China, but has had more success than Apple in rolling out its AI tools in China. It has worked Baidu on its AI features, and has recently launched an AI-intensive version of its virtual assistant Bixby only in China, reported Digital Trends. On January 22, Samsung will launch its new Galaxy S25 series, with Galaxy AI expected to be a major selling point of the lineup. It isn’t clear when Apple Intelligence will get the green light to roll out in China. One of the areas that it is reportedly working on to comply with local regulations is building partnerships with local companies such as Tencent and ByteDance to develop AI tools that can be rolled out in China.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo\n(Reuters) -     Businessman Frank McCourt is \"open-minded\" to keeping TikTok's existing investors, including the founder, involved after any deal to buy the U.S. operations of the Chinese-owned short-form video app, the U.S. billionaire told Reuters on Thursday. McCourt said in an interview his consortium has made a formal offer to buy TikTok from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, confirming reports that it values the app without its algorithm at around $20 billion. The bid is not dependent upon the involvement of U.S. investment firms such as General Atlantic, Susquehanna and Sequoia Capital that own stakes in ByteDance. \"We're also commercial and open-minded to keeping existing investors involved, including the founder,\" said McCourt, who, together with his firm Project Liberty, formed a consortium last year to attempt to buy the social media platform's U.S. operations. The involvement of ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming would be subject to approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. McCourt said Project Liberty has developed technology that will address the national security concerns that led Congress to adopt legislation calling for ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok by Jan. 19, or face a ban in the U.S.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming national security adviser said on Thursday the new administration will keep TikTok alive in the United States if there is a viable deal.
